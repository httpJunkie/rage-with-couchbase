# React, Apollo, GraphQL, and Express Project

In this repo we have two sepereate npm projects:

- An Express/GraphQL Server with Couchbase Server for it's data storage
- A React app using Apollo Client to connect to a GraphQL Server (localhost)

Requires basic setup of Couchbase Server and a sample database:

Once this repo is cloned, cd into each project and run `npm start` or `yarn start` doesn't matter twinkle toes be as unique as you want to be, I don't judge. 

Ensure Couchbase Server is setup locally and the credentials in the `server.js` file are up to date with user and pass from Couchbase Server (Security).
